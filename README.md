# Weather App

A program that returns the current weather and forecast for a given location anywhere in the world, placed in a simple and responsive interface made with React and Chakra UI.

It uses APIs from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to get weather data including the current temperature, visibility, humidity, and five-day forecast with three-hour step. You can retrive data from over 200,000 cities around the world. You can choose whether to display the temperatures in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

You can also alternate between light mode and dark mode.

This program uses the Free tier of APIs.

NOTE: Due to responsiveness issues, you cannot view the forecasts if the screen width is shorter than 680px (vertical orientation on most mobile devices).
